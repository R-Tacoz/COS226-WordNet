/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the algorithm you use in the constructor of
 *  ShortestCommonAncestor to check if the digraph is a rooted DAG.
 **************************************************************************** */



/* *****************************************************************************
 *  The Digraph class you used in your implementation uses an adjacency lists
 *  representation to store a graph. Imagine that you changed this class to
 *  use an adjacency matrix instead. How would this affect the worst case
 *  running time of length() or ancestor()?
 *
 *  Express your answers as functions of the number of vertices V and
 *  the number of edges E in the digraph. Use Big Theta notation
 *  to simplify your answers.
 *
 *  Note that even though you might not use any Digraph methods in either
 *  length() or ancestor(), any method that performs a Breadth First Search
 *  would have to be modified to work with this new representation.
